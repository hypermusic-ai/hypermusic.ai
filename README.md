# Web:

The app is currently developed primarly for Web.

To compile a web project, run in terminal:

flutter build web

and do either 1 or 2:

1. Host the content of the build/web directory at your chosen hosting platform (ex. netlify).

or

2. cd build/web and push to https://github.com/sunsetsobserver/hypermusic.ai_web_build which automatically deploys with Netlify at hypermusic-ai.netlify.app
